Use this device to control Mutable Instrument's module Plaits 'Model' parameter.

Requires Plaits and a MIDI to CV interface to operate.

Connect your interface to your computer, either via MIDI or USB. Connect an output of your interface to Plaits 'Model' CV input. Set Plaits 'Model' to the first top green one, using the top left button to scroll through the list.

In Ableton, select your MIDI Interface as output device on the MIDI track you've loaded the device into. Use the MIDI/CV number to select the output from which your interface is sending out the CV signal. Use the MIDI Channel number to configure the MIDI Channel your output
is set. Set the same channel in Ableton's track as well.

You can now scroll through the different models using both the dropdown men√π or the mappable knob.
